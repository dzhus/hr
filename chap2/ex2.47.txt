To show that formulas are not equivalent, consider any A and take its
characteristic function for F(x) (F(x) iff x is in A).

Example: 
Domain: naturals.
A: even naturals.
F(x): x is even

There're naturals which do not belong to A and are not even, thus the
first formula holds.

For all naturals in A, F(x) holds, thus the second formula does not
hold.
