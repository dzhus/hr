To show that formulas are not equivalent, consider any domain of x for
which F(x) doesn't hold, and take any subset of this domain for A.

Example: 
Domain: even naturals.
A: {2}.
F(x): x is prime.

There's no such even number which is prime and belongs to {2}, thus
the first formula holds.

There's no such even number which is not 2 but is prime, thus the
second formula does not hold.
